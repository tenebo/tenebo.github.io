# First Article

I’ve been thinking about starting a blog where I can write sophisticated articles and showcase my intelligence. However, I feel that my language skills are lacking, and I’m not as smart as an MIT graduate. Still, I’m relatively young, and AGI is in its early stages. I definitely have time to study and learn, and I’d like to spend time documenting this process. I’m planning to write about anime, AI, programming, science, math, and more. I hope I can improve my writing through this process.
