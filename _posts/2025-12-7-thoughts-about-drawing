From a young age, we primarily learn language to understand and express our thoughts. Language is not limited to spoken words; math and physics, universal languages that express the logic of nature, are also forms of language. Then what is the language of visuals? Many methods exist, but they are subsets of drawing. Drawing is a language used to express visual imagination.

However, why is drawing important to me? To be honest, spending more time on CAD and other professional engineering tools is more helpful. Also, AI image generation does a much better job than most people, meaning that I cannot expect any reward from being good at it. However, Japanese anime style has become a standard of beauty for me. Watching these aesthetic visuals motivates me to create my own artwork. Its accessibility (tons of resources, AI image tools, and free digital art tools) also contributes to my motivation.

It is not closely connected to my primary interest, but did Leonardo da Vinci draw the Mona Lisa to improve his engineering skills? He believed that everything is interconnected. It is known that he asked the following questions: What is happening? How is it happening? Why does it happen? Where can this principle be applied? His understanding of the world blended the physics of light and art to create the Mona Lisa.

Indeed, most "basic principles" were founded long ago, and we may never have a well-rounded genius like da Vinci again. However, his idea of blending knowledge from different fields is still valid. We cannot focus only on one thing and be truly creative. Even though millions of people do what I do, which I won’t discuss here, drawing can be a good hobby for me. I would like to spend some time on it, maybe an hour every week, so that it does not distract me from my academics.
